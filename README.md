# Maze Creation and Editing Demo

## Overview
This project is a lightweight demo version of [Maze Creation and Editing Software](https://github.com/Tetley1173/team36-amazing-app), developed individually to showcase essential functionalities of the original application. It includes key features such as an auto-generation algorithm for creating random mazes and an optimal path-finding algorithm for solving them. The application is designed with a streamlined Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing, providing a user-friendly experience for interacting with mazes.

## Features
- **Maze Auto-Generation**: Generates random mazes based on user-specified dimensions.
- **Path-Finding Algorithm**: Finds the optimal solution path within the generated maze.
- **Java Swing GUI**: Interactive user interface built with Java Swing, allowing for easy visualization and interaction with maze functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used for algorithms and GUI development.
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.
